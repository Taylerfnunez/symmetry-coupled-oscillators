# Folder structure

The `exploratory` folder contains files used to build intuition and reproduce
results from the literature.

It has two subfolders:

- `intuition`  
  Contains Python notebooks with notes, figures, side analyses, and scratch work.

- `replication`  
  Contains Python notebooks that reproduce figures or analyses from published papers.
